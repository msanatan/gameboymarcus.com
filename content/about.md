I'm **Marcus**, a software/game dev from Trinidad and Tobago! Current interests revolve around AI, VR and AR - but I love building interesting projects.

- I make mobile and VR games with Unity
- I develop services with Golang, Node.js (Express.js, NestJS), Python (AWS Chalice, Flask)
- I paint frontends with React.js (Next.js)
- I dabble in mobile apps with React Native
