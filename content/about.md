I'm Marcus, a software/game dev from Trinidad and Tobago! Current interests revolve around AI and game development.

- Co-founder at Coplay, the best AI game dev tool for Unity
- OSS maintainer for MCP for Unity
- I develop services with Python (FastAPI), Node.js (Express.js, NestJS) and Golang
- I paint frontends with React.js (Next.js)
- I dabble in mobile apps with React Native
- I like making games with Raylib (C++) and Godot, whenever I get the chance
