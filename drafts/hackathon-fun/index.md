* Saw an AI hackathon, Supabse was hosting it at YC
* Didn't have an idea or a team, but once it kicked off I figured myself out
* First time making a Godot tool, and use Antropic, but those tools are awesome
* Check out Goplay!
* I met a lot of amazing developers from all over the world - and literally all over the world, roughly half the people at the hackathon flew in
* Now I want to go to more of them :-D
