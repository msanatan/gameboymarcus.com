# About Me

Hello there! I'm a game developer hailing from the sunny shores of Trinidad and Tobago. With a background in software development, I'm now spending my time making games.

My goal is simple: to build things that are fun for everyone!

Though a lover of JRPGs and 2D platformers, I've had fun with a variety of experience and this game dev adventure would be as exploratory as well. Hope you enjoy the journey too!
